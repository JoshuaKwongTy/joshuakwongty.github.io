          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            TimeLine was a project my three friends and I created. Our vision
            for TimeLine was to make going out into public much simpler and
            safer for the users. The user interface allows the user to enter in
            their current address or place. From there, the the user will enter
            will enter in a radius in which they would like the program to find
            businesses. Finally, the user will select a specific tag (ex.
            restaurant, supermarket, etc.). When the user presses "Explore", the
            program will find businesses with the specific tag in the given
            radius of their current location. Then, when the program finishes
            scanning, it will its findings into cards that will show up below
            the search bar. These cards will show the "busyness" of the specific
            place and their rating as well as provide the google page of that
            business. To learn about the project in more detail, you can go to

          <h3>Skills</h3>
          <p>
            From this two-day event, my group and I were put under a lot of
            pressure as we had to learn a lot of new languages and utilities.
            The role I was assigned was to create the cards that would
            dynamically show up when the user enters their location. To achieve
            this, I learned three new coding languages: HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. This shows that I had to <b>learn quickly</b> and then
            <b>apply this learned knowledge into practice</b>. During this
            hackathon, I also had to constantly
            <b>communicate effectively</b> with my teammates. Since we were
            working on different aspects of the project, I had to talk to them
            about what my approach to the problem was and what I was doing to
            the code. This allowed me and my group members to build a cohesive
            project.

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Building a welcoming environment encourages drama students to be
            more confident in what they present. In an attempt to bring the
            drama community together, two students created the Drama Game Week.
            Since I was welcomed warmly into the drama community at my high
            school when I first entered it, I was intrigued to help organize the
            event with these two in hopes to welcome new grade nines. Even
            though the poster said that Drama Game Week was going to only run on
            the week of October 12th, it ran until the middle of November due to
            the success of this project. During this event, the participants
            would socialize with fellow Arts Unionville students and play games
            to strengthen the bond between the grades and fellow classmates.

          <h3>Skills</h3>
          <p>
            In this project, I was responsible for creating posts on social
            media, leading conversations, and managing the platform with which
            everyone would be communicating with. Since there were a lot of
            applicants, I learned how to properly
            <b>organize large amounts of data</b>. This skill transferred to my
            note-taking as I was more organized with my notes and became less
            overwhelmed. I also improved my <b>leadership</b> through this event
            as I had to lead many different small groups.

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            I created this money converter because in the future, when the
            COVID-19 pandemic ends, I want to travel around the world. So, by
            creating this currency converter the user is able to quickly convert
            one currency to another depending on the country they are going. I
            have also added another feature where it tells the user what type of
            currency a certain country uses. This allows the user to correctly
            convert their currency to the currency the country is currently
            using.

            From this project, I learned how to deal with <b>JSON files</b> and
            developed a further understanding on the <b>Python</b> programming
            language. In this project, I have considered about using an API;
            however, all of the money APIs required payments.
