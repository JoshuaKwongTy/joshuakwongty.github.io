          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            TimeLine was a project my three friends and I created. Our vision
            for TimeLine was to make going out into public much simpler and
            safer for the users. The user interface allows the user to enter in
            their current address or place. From there, the the user will enter
            will enter in a radius in which they would like the program to find
            businesses. Finally, the user will select a specific tag (ex.
            restaurant, supermarket, etc.). When the user presses "Explore", the
            program will find businesses with the specific tag in the given
            radius of their current location. Then, when the program finishes
            scanning, it will its findings into cards that will show up below
            the search bar. These cards will show the "busyness" of the specific
            place and their rating as well as provide the google page of that
            business. To learn about the project in more detail, you can go to

          <h3>Skills</h3>
          <p>
            From this hackathon, I have learned how to learn quickly and
            <b>communicate effectively</b> with my teammates. Since this
            competition was two days long, our team could not waste time. I had
            to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during those days and apply them
            immediately to the project. In the project, I was mainly responsible
            for the cards that show up dynamically when the user entered in
            their location. For this, I mainly coded in JavaScript, but I also
            wrote the HTML to accompany it. On the left side of the screen, you
            can see a portion of this JavaScript code. By doing this project, I
            have learned how to
            <b>work more effeciently and pick up knowledge quickly</b>. I also
            had to communicate effectively with my teammates. Since everyone was
            working on different aspects of the project, I had to communicate
            what I was working on and how I was going to execute it. This
            allowed my teammates to work with me and build a cohesive project
            instead of four seperate projects. All in all, this hackathon helped
            me learn how absorb knowledge quickly and how to critically apply
            this knowledge into my work. This project also taught me how to
            communicate effectively with others in a high pressure situation.

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Building a welcoming environment encourages drama students to be
            more confident in what they present. In an attempt to bring the
            drama community together, two students created the Drama Game Week.
            Since I was welcomed warmly into the drama community at my high
            school when I first entered it, I was intrigued to help organize the
            event with these two in hopes to welcome new grade nines. Even
            though the poster said that Drama Game Week was going to only run on
            the week of October 12th, it ran until the middle of November due to
            the success of this project. During this event, the participants
            would socialize with fellow Arts Unionville students and play games
            to strengthen the bond between the grades and fellow classmates.

          <h3>Skills</h3>
          <p>
            In this project, I was responsible for creating posts on social
            media, leading conversations and games that we would be playing, and
            managing the platform with which everyone would be communicating
            with. Since there were a lot of applicants, I learned how to
            properly organize large amounts of data. This skill transferred to
            my note-taking as I was more organized with my notes and became less
            overwhelmed. I also improved my leadership through this event as I
            had to lead many different small groups.

          <p>
            I created this money converter because in the future, when the
            COVID-19 pandemic ends, I want to travel around the world. So, by
            creating this currency converter the user is able to quickly convert
            one currency to another depending on the country they are going. I
            have also added another feature where it tells the user what type of
            currency a certain country uses. This allows the user to correctly
            convert their currency to the currency the country is currently
            using.

            From this project, I learned how to deal with JSON files and
            developed a further understanding on the Python programming
            language. In this project, I have considered about using an API;
            however, all of the money APIs required payments.
