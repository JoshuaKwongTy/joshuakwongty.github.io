            Hi! I am Joshua and I am currently a first year student studying
            Chemical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. The degree that
            I will have at the end of my undergraduate will be the "Bachelor of
            Applied Science".

            Below, you will see three separate cards. Hover over them to read
            the text associated with the certain topic.

              I find that being able to create anything with just elements
              extremely exciting. I believe that a deep understanding of
              elements will allow us to create innovative, productive, and
              durable products. I also find the concept of recycling to be very
              intriguing. The thought of taking the elements from an object that
              is either broken or useless and turning those elements into a
              product that is extremely useful is fascinating to me.

              I am interested in the animal biology field. Specifically, the
              psychology of different species of animals. I am also interested
              in the field of forensics science. I participated in HOSA, a
              biology contest and competed as part of the forensics team. There,
              I learned many ways to identify people from the evidence and how
              to recreate crime scenes. However, I found entomology in forensics
              extremely compelling.

              In a world of finite materials, we have to conserve as much as
              possible. This would mean that we would have to make the most of
              the materials that we create. Through my works as a chemical
              engineer, I want to create more effective and durable products. As
              a result, there would be less waste which will lead to less
              materials being burned and wasted.
