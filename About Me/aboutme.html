      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Joshua and I am currently studying Chemical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I have experience in the manufacturing field, specifically in the automotive and pharmaceutical industry where I was responsible for 
        ensuring product quality and managing multiple projects at once. I am currently completing my second work term at MMR Consulting where I will be working closely with and improving chemical processes that are responsible for creating 
        pharmaceutical products.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In my free time I enjoy playing sports such as basketball and badminton and I also like playing video games. While I'm chilling or driving, I typically put on murder mystery podcasts or something about the supernatural. Do I know why I like
        scaring myself? I have no idea. But, I do like the adrenaline rush I get when I get jumpscared or thinking about scary topics.
      </p>
