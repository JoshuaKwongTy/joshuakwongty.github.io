          <p>
            Hi! I am Joshua and I am currently a first year student studying
            Chemical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. The degree that
            I will have at the end of my undergraduate will be the "Bachelor of
            Applied Science".

            Below, you will see three separate cards. Hover over them to read
            the text associated with the certain topic.

              <p>I study Chemical Engineering because of my interest in elements. 
                I believe that a deep understanding of elements will allow us to <b>create 
                innovative, productive, and durable products</b> as they can be thought of as the
                building blocks of our world. </p>
              <p></p> 
              <p>I find the <b>design of processes</b> interesting as well. Being able to build a chemical process that brings in one 
                type of material and outputs another is cool to me. This interest of mine has grown through 
                the use of <b>AutoCAD Plant 3D</b>, which I practiced using in my chemical engineering design course. In the future, 
                I plan to research more on <b>P&IDs</b> and how to effectively use AutoCAD Plant 3D.

              <p>One of my interests is in the field of <b>forensics science</b>. I participated in <b>HOSA</b>, a biology contest, 
              and competed as part of the forensics team. There, I learned many ways to identify people from the evidence and 
              how to recreate crime scenes. Specifically, I found <b>entomology</b> in forensics extremely compelling.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>My hobbies include playing <b>badminton</b> and <b>basketball</b>. I also enjoy watching anime and playing video games 
              like most people do :)</p>

              As a chemical engineer, my goal is to create more <b>effective and durable products</b>. As we know, materials are finite 
              so we have to conserve as much as we can. By creating such products, there would be fewer materials being burned and 
              wasted, while at the same time, making these products more <b>productive</b> than their predecessors.
