#Personal Website

##What Does it Contain?
In my website, you can read about my interests, projects, aspirations, and my field of study.
Think of it as my resume but more in-depth about who I am and written in code.

##Improvements
As of right now, I am trying to make a functional contact page where your inputs as the
user are stored somewhere (either a json or text file). I have working contact page that only runs on my laptop
which has PHP and JS; however, hosting the website will require XAMMP which is not supported by GitHub pages.
The version on my laptop will get user input and print it on a text file for the owner of the page is able to read.
I will find a resolution to this in the future, so sit tight and wait :slight_smile:  
The design of the website might also change from time to time to improve usability and comfortability for the user.
If you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out to me!
